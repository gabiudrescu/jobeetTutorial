symfony
=======

A Symfony project created on July 21, 2015, 8:33 pm. 

I was tried to replicate [this tutorial](http://intelligentbee.com/blog/2013/08/07/symfony2-jobeet-day-1-starting-up-the-project/) and improve the techniques used to develop it.

Due to lack of good planning, I failed and decided to start from scratch. Again. Hopefull, next time will mark this as "done".


Awesomeness with Travis CI & Coveralls:
